## *Module 13, Challenge -  Data Science & Machine Learning - Neural Networks, DeepLearning*
Objective - Compile and Evaluate a Binary Classification Model using a Neural Network that predicts if applicants will be successful if funded through venture capital firm. 

Scenario - Given a historical dataset CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding, employ neural network knowledge to evaluate dataset features and create a binary classifier model that will predict an applicant will become a successful or failed business.  

Product - Jupyter notebook with -

* > Data preprocessing for a neural network model.
* > binary classification model using a deep neural network.
* > Utilize model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate.
* > Model optimization.

## Supplemental Modeling and Analysis

Supplemental processing and analysis:

Beyond the scope of the assignment, the author sought to conduct additional analysis of the data obtained; supplemental material script with model building follows the primary challenge. Additionally, supplemetal experimental notebooks are included.

### **Dependencies**

This project leverages Jupyter Lab v3.4.4 and Python version 3.9.13 packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 27 2022, 17:01:00) with the following packages:


* [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) - module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) - an open source Python library used for working with arrays, contains multidimensional array and matrix data structures with functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - software library written for the python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

* [Path](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.concat.html) - from pathlib - Object-oriented filesystem paths, Path instantiates a concrete path for the platform the code is running on.

* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html) - an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning; provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection, model evaluation, and many other utilities.

* [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - an end-to-end machine learning platform.

* [tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) - a compact, easy to learn, high-level Python library run on top of TensorFlow framework; made with focus of understanding deep learning techniques, such as creating layers for neural networks maintaining the concepts of shapes and mathematical details.

* [keras](https://keras.io/about/) - a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow.

* [train_test_split](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) - from sklearn.model_selection, a quick utility that wraps input validation and next(ShuffleSplit().split(X, y)) and application to input data into a single call for splitting (and optionally subsampling) data in a oneliner.

* [OneHotEncoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) - from sklearn.preprocessing, encode categorical features as a one-hot numeric array. Features are encoded using a one-hot (aka ‘one-of-K’ or ‘dummy’) encoding scheme; creates a binary column for each category and returns a sparse matrix or dense array.

* [StandardScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) - from sklearn.preprocessing, standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

* [matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html) a state-based interface to matplotlib. It provides an implicit, MATLAB-like, way of plotting. It also opens figures on your screen, and acts as the figure GUI manager
